# FlowerClassifier

For training the model I have used google colab. I have used Pytorch library and used transfer learning approach to train the model. The model architecture used is ResNet.

You can download the trained model from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g-aialJ83Y4EcSEn9aAvKHcAt0bR7Xjp/view?usp=sharing)

I have used Kaggle dataset to train the model, [link](https://www.kaggle.com/msheriey/104-flowers-garden-of-eden) for the dataset.

After training and validating the model I have used flask framework to develop a API, once API I deployed it on the Heroku Webserver.
